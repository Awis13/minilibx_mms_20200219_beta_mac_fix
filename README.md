# MiniLibX Fixed for macOS

![Screenshot](./screen.png)

Hey there! This is a fixed version of the MiniLibX library for macOS users. We've patched up some issues in the Swift code and made it more compatible with different systems.

## What's Fixed?

I've addressed a few warnings and errors in the Swift code, including:

- Properly initializing `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`
- Using `withUnsafeMutableBytes` instead of the temporary pointer
- Fixed an issue with dynamic library loading at runtime

These fixes make the library more compatible with different macOS systems and improve overall stability.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Compile the library using the provided Makefile
3. ???????
4. Profit
